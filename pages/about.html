                    My name is Ashlynn Roarick. I tend go by Ashley, however, because I have spent half of my life
                    correcting
                    people
                    and
                    the other half forgetting the second "n". I am 18 years old currently, which makes me an adult. An
                    aspiring
                    adult, to be more specfic. I graduated high school as the Class of 2019. I, however, did not go the
                    more traditional route.

                The
                summer
                before my
                senior year was spent researching how to take the hours I had accumulated from dual-credit courses
                and
                transfer
                them
                to, and start taking classes from, a local community college. Therefore, instead of go to my last
                football
                game,
                homecoming, and yes, even prom, I finished out my high school career as a 17 year old college
                sophmore.

                My non-traditional education route did not end there though. After the Spring semester of 2019, I
                decided
                that
                going to
                a college and spending tens of thousands of dollars in order to get "the full college expirience"
                was not
                worth
                it. So, the summer of
                2019 was spent researching different coding bootcamps. I went through many before landing of the
                Full-Stack
                Web
                Development Bootcamp at
                Southern Methodist University (aka SMU).
